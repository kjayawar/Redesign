# Redesign
## A program to find Î±* distribution of a given airfoil using Fourier Coefficients

## Theoritical Derivation

![png](Redesign_Docs_files/Formulation.PNG)

In practice, the Fourier coeifficients that goes in to the program can be generated through **MDES -> Pert** menu in **XFoil**  
This approach generally works on any airfoil, regardless of non-equially spaced phi, camber and thickenss distribution, additional LE points etc, and hence could be considered very flexible. 

## Implementation and Usage

Actual implementation details listed in the Redesign.py file closly follow what is been described above with heavily commented functions.  
As for the usage; this can be run on a notebook as shown below or on any other python REPL.


```python
from redesign import *
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [12, 5]
```

The input file goes in to the program is a list of Furier coeificients [Cn] from Xfoil. For ex:


```python
!type E587.pert
```

The above graph shows the calculated $\alpha^*$ destribution of Eppler-587 airfoil.  
Referece line in red shows the actual $\nu - \alpha^*$ destribution which was used to generate the airfoil

## Note

Probably due to the discontiniuety of the harmonic series at the LE, ripples present in the redesigned $\alpha^*$ destribution.  
As per my understanding this cannot easily be overcome given the nature of the $P(\phi)$  
For practical purposes, this should'nt cause too much trouble - a larger phi spacing can be used if required, which mitigates the issue somewhat.  
Any pull request adressing this specific issue is very welcome
